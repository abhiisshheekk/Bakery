## Brief Introduction

This is a simple one page react js application for a bakery which gives functionality to adding and removing items into and from the cart. By clicking on the cart button we can see the total checkout amount. It is just a frontend application, so it will not be able to do anything else. 

## Setup

1. Make sure you have npm(8.10.0 or above) installed as well as reactjs of version 17.0.2 or above.
2. Clone the repo using: ```git clone git@github.com:abhiisshheekk/Bakery.git```
3. Enter the directory: ```cd Bakery```
4. Install node modules: ```npm install```
5. Finally, run the development server: ```npm start```. The webpage will be accessible at port 3000 of localhost.
